### Milestone Project 3: Data-Centric Development


"*Tandem language learning is a method of language learning based on mutual language exchange between tandem partners, where ideally each learner is a native speaker in the language the other party wants to learn...*"

tanDev is about this... but for developers.

Conceived as a platform to connect developers and designers who wish to learn from each other and work together, the project features a Python backend and a MongoDB database.

The current deployed version can be accessed at: https://tandev.herokuapp.com/index.
