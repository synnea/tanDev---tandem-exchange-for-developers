### Milestone Project 3: Data-Centric Development

[!indexpage](https://github.com/synnea/tanDev--tandem-for-devs/blob/master/static/img/amiresponsive_index.PNG)

[tanDev](https://tandev.herokuapp.com/index) is a skill exchange platform created by Carina PÃ¶ll to connect developers and designers with each other who wish to exchange their skills.

The term 'tandem' is taken from the language learning community, in which it means:

"*Tandem language learning is a method of language learning based on mutual language exchange between tandem partners, where ideally each learner is a native speaker in the language the other party wants to learn...*"

The tandem exchange concept is taken to connect developers and designers skilled in some languages or areas of development who wish to improve their skills in others.

## UX

The website's target audience are developers and designers. For developers based in Berlin, the option to search for users by district is useful; for all others, tanDev also seeks to connect individuals who wish to exchange their skills via text or video.

The website features a multi-page design. Three pages - index, about, and search - are accessible to non-members. For registered users, there is also a user area, where users may write, edit, publish and delete their profiles.
