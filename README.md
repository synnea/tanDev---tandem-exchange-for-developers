# A Dashboard of Ice and Fire

### Milestone Project 3: Data-Centric Development

![indexpage](https://github.com/synnea/tanDev--tandem-for-devs/blob/master/static/img/amiresponsive_index.PNG)

[tanDev](https://tandev.herokuapp.com/index) is a skill exchange platform created by Carina PÃ¶ll to connect developers and designers with each other who wish to exchange their skills.

The term 'tandem' is taken from the language learning community, in which it means:

"*Tandem language learning is a method of language learning based on mutual language exchange between tandem partners, where ideally each learner is a native speaker in the language the other party wants to learn...*"

The tandem exchange concept is taken to connect developers and designers skilled in some languages or areas of development who wish to improve their skills in others.

## UX

The website's target audience are developers and designers. For developers based in Berlin, the option to search for users by district is useful; for all others, tanDev also seeks to connect individuals who wish to exchange their skills via text or video.

To appeal to the target audience, tanDev features a modern design. A blue color scheme was chosen, as blue is a color closely associatied with technology.

The main hero image featured on tanDev is one of two puzzle pieces being put together. This symbolizes the main mission of the website: to bring together people whose skills complement one another.

The website features a multi-page design. Three pages - index, about, and search - are accessible to non-members. For registered users, there is also a user area, where users may write, edit, publish and delete their profiles.

The design features a static navbar which is transparent and appears upon scroll for desktop users on some pages (mainly index and search). The navbar is fixed for mobile users and inside the user area of the tanDev.

FontAwesome icons are provided throughout the website to aid intuitive information input.

### User Stories

The following user stories were used to design the website:

- I am a developer or designer based in Berlin. I heard about tanDev and have an idea what it's about. I am interested in finding out if there are other developers in the city with whom I could exchange my skills with.
- I am a developer or designer based in Berlin. I stumble upon tanDev without knowing what it is.
- I am a developer or designer not based in Berlin. 
- I am a tech recruiter interested in contacting available talent.
- I am a startup entrepreneur interested in finding a co-founder with complementary skills.


### Wireframes

Extensive wireframes with Balsamiq were created for the project. As an example, here is a wireframe for the index page:

![index-wire](https://github.com/synnea/tanDev--tandem-for-devs/blob/master/static/img/wireframe_index.jpg)


The wireframes for every page on the website are available in .pdf format on this github respository: [DESKTOP VERSION](https://github.com/synnea/tanDev--tandem-for-devs/blob/master/schemas/wireframes/wireframes%20desktop.pdf) and [MOBILE VERSION](https://github.com/synnea/tanDev--tandem-for-devs/blob/master/schemas/wireframes/wireframes%20for%20mobile.pdf).

A color palette was created early on, using the colors found in the background image as the basic point of reference. The palette was created using https://coolors.co/. The decision was taken early on that the website would feature a blue color scheme.

For the most part, the wireframes are similar to the finished product. However, some features were taken out due to time restraints: originally, the skill levels were supposed to be illustrated in a star rating on the search page, user details page as well as the profile page. However due to complexity of the dataset, this was later taken out.

An initially envisioned option to favorite other users was also removed, and has been added to the 'future features' wishlist.

### Data Schema

tanDev is backed by a MongoDB database. Only one collection is in use, the 'profile' collection. Here is the data schema used for individual documents in this collection:

| Key               | Value           |
| -------------     |:-------------:| 
| _id               | < integer > | 
| username          | < string >  |  
| imgUrl            |  < string > | 
| district          | < string >  |  
| shortDescription  | < string >  | 
| communicationStyle| < array >   |  
| skills            | < array >   | 
| desiredSkills     | < array >   |  
| otherDetails      | < array >   | 
| github            | < string >  |
| published         | < datetime >| 
| display           | < boolean > |  

The database was populated early on with 13 original profiles. 


## Features

### Current Features

#### Feature 1 - Carousel
The index page features a carousel of user profiles who have been published on tanDev.

#### Feature 2 - Animation on Scroll
The 'about' page features animation on scroll achieved through the [AOS library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/).

#### Feature 3 - Search function
The search page of tanDev allows the users to search the database for other users who have published their profiles. Searches can be executed according to desired skills, location (Berlin districts), communication styles, and other details. The search page also features pagination.

#### Feature 4 - Toggleable Sidebar
The search page also features a sidebar, which is fixed on desktop view, but toggleable on mobile, with a smooth transition animation.

#### Feature 5 - Eye-Catching Animated Usernames
In the user details view, the username is animated with an infinite text shadow keyframe.

#### Feature 6 - Preview Option
After successfully saving his or her details, the user may preview what their information would look like in a profile view.

#### Feature 7 - Flexible Navbar design
On the search and about pages, the navbar is transparent and pops into view upon scroll. On the other pages, and on mobile view, the navbar is dark and fixed.



### Features Left to Implement

#### Messaging 
Currently, there is no way for users to connect with other users on tanDev. A messaging function of some sort is needed.

#### Favoriting
The option to favorite users and save them in a 'my favorites' tab of the my account dropdown is also a feature that is missing and which would add a lot of value to the website's UX.

**Python**
* [PEP8Online](http://pep8online.com/).
    - At the time of writing this readme, the Python code in this project contains a total of 10 lines which exceed the recommended max length of 79 characters. I chose to leave them in because breaking them up resulted in less readability. The PEP8 guide states that its guidelines could be bent on an individual basis when doing so raised readability, hence I chose to do so here. Apart from those 10 lines, the code is fully PEP8-compliant.
