            <p>What do you think when you hear the word 'tandem'? </p>
            <p>You might think of the tandem bicycle, popular in the 19th century, which allowed two people to ride a
                bicycle together.</p>
            <p>You might also think of the more modern definition when two learners of foreign languages come together
                to practice and help each other</p>
            <p> Here at tanDev, we took the core concept of tandem as a <strong>combined effort</strong> and
                <strong>skill exchange</strong> to help connect developers and designers who want to both teach and
                learn from others.</p>
            <p>Know Python, but bad with design?</p>
            <p>Or maybe an old-school dev with masterful PHP skills but no idea of all these newfangled languages?</p>
            <p>Create a profile and search for other people with the skills you desire to get started exchanging your skills now! Once connected, it's up to you to figure out a tandem that works best for you, be that over text, voice or in person.*</p>
